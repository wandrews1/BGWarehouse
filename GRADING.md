This is the webserver that is being used to host Faceboard, assignment 1 for CS350. This will constantly be updated throughout the semester with various projects being worked on.

## Grading:
1. There are 2 *Simple Variables* in the [Server](server.py), date and time, which are kept in a *python dictionary* and regurgitated for the user on the [Index page](/templates/index.html). 
2. The *Conditional statement* is [Index](templates/index.html). The days of the week are kept in a variable and will print out a little message according to the day of the week.
3. The *For Loop* is in [Gallery](/templates/gallery.html). The images are kept in a list, and the for loop cycles through the list, showing the gallery of images.
4. The website has *5 pages*.
